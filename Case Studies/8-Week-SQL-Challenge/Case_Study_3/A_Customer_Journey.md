### ðŸ¥‘ A. Customer Journey

Based off the 8 sample customers provided in the sample from the subscriptions table, write a brief description about each customerâ€™s onboarding journey.
Try to keep it as short as possible - you may also want to run some sort of join to make your explanations a bit easier!


#### 1. Total Number of Customers
```sql
select count(distinct customer_id) as total_subscribers
from subscriptions;
```
#### Result:-

#### 2. Number of customers who cancelled the subscription after trial period
```sql
with sub_ranking as 
(select *,
rank() over (partition by customer_id order by start_date asc) as first_day,
rank() over (partition by customer_id order by start_date desc) as last_day
from subscriptions
order by customer_id)
select count(distinct customer_id) as customer_cancel_post_trial 
from sub_ranking
where first_day = 2 and last_day = 1
and plan_id = 4;
```
#### Result:-
