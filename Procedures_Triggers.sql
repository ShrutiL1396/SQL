/*Question 13. Trigger (15%) : Create a trigger named trg_mem_balance that will
maintain the correct value in the membership balance in the MEMBERSHIP table
when videos are returned late. The trigger should execute as an AFTER trigger when
the due date or return date attributes are updated in the DETAILRENTAL table. The
Trigger should satisfy the following conditions:
a. Calculate the value of the late fee prior to the update that triggered this
execution of the trigger. The value of the late fee is the days late multiplied
by the daily late fee. If the previous value of the late fee was null, then treat it
as zero (0).
b. Calculate the value of the late fee after the update that triggered this execution
of the trigger. If the value of the late fee is now null, then treat it as zero (0).
c. Subtract the prior value of the late fee from the current value of the late fee to
determine the change in late fee for this video rental.
d. If the amount calculated in Part c is not zero (0), then update the membership
balance by the amount calculated for the membership associated with this
rental. */

Q14.
Create a stored procedure named prc_new_rental
to insert new rows in the RENTAL table. The procedure should satisfy the following
conditions:
a. The membership number will be provided as parameter.
b. Use a count() function to verify that the membership number exits in the
MEMBERSHIP table. If it does not exist, then a message should be displayed
that the membership does not exist and no data should be written to the
database.
c. If the membership does exist, then retrieve the membership balance and
display a message that the balance is the previous balance. (e.g., if the
membership has a balance of 5.00, then display â€œprevious balance: $ 5.00.)
d. Insert a new row in the rental table using the rent_num_seq sequence created
to generate the value for RENT_NUM, the current system date for the
RENT_DATE value, and the membership number provided as the value for
MEM_NUM.*/
